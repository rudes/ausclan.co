			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>Australia OSRS is an Australian/New Zealand-based social OldSchool RuneScape clan with an emphasis on mid to high level PVM in a casual environment. You don't have to be a giga-chad gamer god to join our clan and we're happy to teach people the ropes and give out helpful advice.<br>
<br>
We generally aim to do four events per week, ranging from Group Bossing, Pking, Power Hours, as well as Skill/Boss of the Weeks and the occasional social gathering. Our clan does plenty of Chambers, Theatre, Nightmare and Bossing if you're interesting in joining or learning the ropes. If you're interested then simply click the either the Apply tab for more information or apply through the Discord tab.</p>

		<div id="Apply" class="tab" style="display: none">

There are no requirements to hang out in our clan or come to our public events. We're happy to accept all iron accounts, pures and fresh players alike so don't be afraid to apply.</p>
